# Grid of Drugs

![](https://github.com/NicEastvillage/CreateJam19S/blob/master/Assets/Sprites/Clickbait.png)

With inspiration from the 80's (1978 close enough) game Snake, the TV-series Stranger Things, the TRON movies and the 80's drug industry in Miami.
Please Send Help presents: **GOD**

*Disclaimer: GOD is short for the Grid of Drugs.*

GOD resolves around an amazing narrative involving Mike and Lucas (you might know them from Stranger Things), who both desprately are seeking highs in the mid 80's and comes to the Grid of Drugs to scoot against eachother in a highspeed competion to obtain more drugs than each other.

GOD is a multiplayer game played on one PC, where one player will be playing as Mike (blue) and one as Lucas (orange). The controls are ARROW-keys for Mike's movement and WASD-keys for Lucas' movement. Good luck on the Grid of Drugs!
